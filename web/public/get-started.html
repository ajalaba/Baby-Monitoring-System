    <h3>INTRODUCTION</h3>
    <p></p>
    <p>
        The BabyMonitor Web Application is a project created by ADV; a group of 2nd year Software Engineering students. 
    </p>
    <P>
        We developed this web application to help parents and caretakers to monitor the health and activity statistics of a baby. So, busy parents can leave their babies in their rooms without worrying too much about accidents occuring.
